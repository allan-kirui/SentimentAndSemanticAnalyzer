    "title": "Kenya exempts Ethiopia, South Africa from e-travel authorisation fees",
    "text": "Kenya has begun twitching its online visitor registration service that policymakers wanted to use to ease travel into the country, but which saw some countries complain of high charges.\n\nAnd now, the Department of Immigration and Citizen Services says citizens from Ethiopia and five other countries will not be required to pay the $30 per traveller charged when visitors apply to come to Kenya.\n\nThe fee is often paid online via the portal www.etakenya.go.ke after the government launched the Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) in January. According to the department, citizens from the Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Eritrea, Mozambique, San Marino and South Africa will also no longer be charged when filing for eTA applications.\n\nThe department said these are “countries which had concluded visa abolitions agreement or signed bilateral visa waiver agreements with the Republic of Kenya.”\n\nThe five had signed visa exemption deals in the last one year. Their exemption from eTA began on February 15, Immigration said in response to a Business Daily inquiry on Wednesday.\n\nBacha Debele, the Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya had on Monday told Ethiopian nationals wishing to travel to Kenya to file free applications for ETA, which remains mandatory.\n\n“My heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the Government of Kenya for its prompt response and kind decision to remove Ethiopian citizens from Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) related electronic payment requirement,” he said.\n\n“We kindly inform our citizens that they can enter Kenya without any requirement for visa and its related payment, but the requirement to fill eTA form online before arrival, remains mandatory.”\n\nEthiopia is among the earliest countries to sign visa exemption pacts with Nairobi, with its agreements being in place for the last five decades. But while Kenyans only need valid passports to travel to Ethiopia, Ethiopians had been, for the last two months, required to pay $30 for ETA applied for at least 72 hours before arrival.\n\nThe system has generated complaints, especially from countries that routinely do not demand visas from Kenya. The new changes are part of ongoing consultations with foreign partners to improve it, a source told the Business Daily on Wednesday but gave no timelines on when the review will be completed.\n\nRead: Airlines, crew face Sh1.6m fines for passengers breaching eTA rules\n\nWhile it was launched to ease travel and visa application processes, critics argued the $30 fee is a visa by another name.\n\nImmigration said applications for eTA will still be pegged 72 hours before arrival.\n\n“An Issued eTA is valid for travel to Kenya within 90 days from the date of issue.”\n\nHowever, it may face another question from critics who say the eTA application is not flexible, especially if one adjusts travel times or needs emergency travel.\n\nAs it is, East African Community member states will be exempt from applying for ETA and can travel as long as they have valid passports or national identification.",

    "title": "Kenya Eurobond yields fall as investor jitters recede",
    "text": "Yields on Kenyan Eurobonds have fallen into the single digits territory as investor jitters wear off following the partial payment of the Sh285.6 billion ($2 billion) debut Eurobond.\n\nInterest rates on the Eurobond maturing in June have, for instance, tumbled to 9.93 percent as of Monday’s close from a high of 15.09 percent on February 9, 2024.\n\nThe return from other Eurobond issues has marked a similar turn with yields on the seven-year sovereign bond maturing in 2027 hitting a low of 8.611 percent from 11.64 percent over the same period.\n\nYields on the 10-year Eurobond maturing in 2028, the 12-year bond maturing in 2032 and the 13-year bond maturing in 2034 have similarly fallen to 9.475, 9.939 percent and 9.749 respectively.\n\nInterest rates on the longer-dated 30-year Eurobond maturing in 2048 have also eased considerably to 10.436 percent from 10.82 percent on February 7.\n\nAccording to analysts, the falling yields mirror a risk adjustment on Kenyan sovereign assets in the international capital markets as investor concerns surrounding the ability of the country to meet maturities shrink.\n\n“The risk premium attached to the 2024 Eurobond has eased, leading to the fall in yields. This has had the contagion effect of cutting yields in other issued Eurobonds as investors begin to look at Kenyan assets favourably,” said Churchill Ogutu, an economist at IC Asset Managers.\n\nLast week, the National Treasury bought back Sh205.6 billion ($1.44 billion) notes from the debut 2014 Eurobond following the issuance of a new Eurobond of a similar amount net of lead arranger fees.\n\nThe buyback has served to diminish fears around Kenya’s ability to meet the maturity on schedule with the country now expected to clear a reduced, remaining balance of Sh79.5 billion ($557 million) on June 24.\n\nThe buyback has been the first move by Kenya to implement liability management operations following the contracting of Citi and Standard banks as lead managers to oversee the redemption of the 2014 Eurobond.\n\nThe exchequer has outlined plans to further leverage liability operations as a debt management tool, especially for external debt.\n\nDebt swaps and buybacks have been identified as part of liability management operations which forms part of the exchequer’s envisioned public debt management reforms.\n\n“To lower costs and risks associated with the existing public debt portfolio, the government will apply liability management operations targeting the existing debt portfolio. The operations will include debt swaps and buy-backs,” said the National Treasury in its medium-term debt strategy report.\n\n“The government also endeavours to maintain its presence in international financial markets through refinancing the existing commercial maturities and mobilising resources for budget support.”\n\nTo make the buyback, however, Kenya parted with a premium having offered investors a 9.75 percent return on in its new seven-year Sh214.2 billion ($1.5 billion) Eurobond, which contrasts with a lower priced Eurobond issuance by Benin and Côte d’Ivoire, respectively.\n\nThe higher rate on the new bond which further contrasts to a coupon of 6.875 percent from the debut Eurobond and will see Kenyans incur Sh20.8 billion ($146.25 million) in annual interest payments, payable every six months.\n\nBeyond Kenyan assets looking more favourable after the buyback, the local exchange rate has seen its fortune turn after the new issuance released fresh dollar inflows in the market.\n\nThe inflows have improved the forex liquidity in the market featuring the release of dollars by hoarders, elevating the Kenya Shilling to record gains of nearly two decades against the US dollar last week.\n\nAt the close of trading on Monday, the CBK quoted the local unit at Sh142.81 against the US dollar compared to Sh158.66 a week prior.",

    "title": "KenGen to drill geothermal wells in Tanzania",
    "text": "Listed electricity generating company KenGen will soon sign a contract to drill three explorative wells in Tanzania, as the neighbouring nation seeks to plug into geothermal energy.\n\nKenGen managing director and chief executive Peter Njenga, says within the next one month, the company should have kicked off operations in Tanzania, a move aimed at cementing its revenue diversification through venturing into markets outside Kenya.\n\nKenGen started drilling its first well in Djibouti in November 2021 following the securing of a Sh709.0 million contract in February that year. In the same year, the Kenyan firm bagged contracts for the drilling of wells and consultancy in Ethiopia.\n\n“One of the things we are doing is aggressive diversification in looking at outward markets. We are in Ethiopia; we are in Djibouti. Malawi has visited us and they are interested in us helping them explore their geothermal. We also have Tanzania, Zambia and Rwanda. Tanzania is now exploring its geothermal capacity and it is a small project which we intend to be done within three months,” Mr Njenga told the Business Daily.\n\nMr Njenga says the regional foray is expected to bolster the company’s performance with the target of closing the full year ending June 2024 at Sh8.0 billion in net earnings, a 59.5 percent increase from the Sh5.0 billion reported at the close of June 2023.\n\n“What we are looking at is to make sure that we increase our profits. Looking at our asset base which is at around Sh500 billion, we expect actually to be making well above Sh10 billion as profit every year,” Mr Njenga said adding that the firm recorded a profit after tax of Sh5.2 billion in the full year to June 2023, a growth of 48 percent from Sh3.38 billion, and it is counting on diversification to boost its fortunes.\n\nThe company’s profit surge was driven by a 14 percent jump in its revenues, which grew to Sh53.96 billion up from Sh47.5 billion in 2022.\n\n“We still have a long way to go and we are pushing very hard to improve efficiencies of generation because that is one area where we can do very well and ensure we have more revenue from our generators. We are targeting Sh10.0 billion within the next three years,” Mr Njenga says.\n\nKenGen announced the payment of Sh545.2 million worth of dividends on February 16 to 190,784 shareholders following approval in the annual general meeting held last year.",

    "title": "Fresh pain at the pump as State triples Epra levy",
    "text": "The government has raided the pockets of fuel consumers once again after it tripled the tax payable to the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) for every litre of the commodity purchased.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy last week increased the Petroleum Regulatory Levy to Sh0.75 per litre up from Sh0.25.\n\nThe levy is one of nine taxes and levies that are charged on fuel, and has been increased to fund the operations of the energy regulator.  The others are excise duty, Road Maintenance Levy, Petroleum Development Levy, Railway Development Levy, Anti-Adulteration Levy, Merchant Shipping Levy, Import Declaration Fee and Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nThe increase of the levy last week went largely unnoticed because the energy regulator reduced the overall price of fuel by Sh1 per litre.\n\nEnergy Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir last week published the Energy (Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority Petroleum Levy) Regulations, 2024 giving effect to the new charge.\n\nEnergy Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir last week published the Energy (Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority Petroleum Levy) Regulations, 2024 giving effect to the new charge.\n\nFuel price high\nHowever, the increase in the petroleum levy means consumers will pay more at the pump even as fuel prices remain high.\n\nEpra last week set prices of fuel at Sh195.47 per litre of diesel and Sh206.36 per litre of super petrol in Nairobi, down from Sh196.47 and Sh207.36 respectively. Fuel consumers could soon be hit with further price increases if proposals by the Kenya Roads Board (KRB) are approved.\n\nKRB in its latest strategic plan proposes a Sh5 a litre raise on Road Maintenance Fuel Levy (RMFL) arguing that the cost of maintaining roads in the country has shot up substantially from costlier fuel prices to the cost of key road construction materials including tar and bitumen and is expected to impact the cost of periodic road maintenance by road agencies in the 2023/24 fiscal year which commenced July 1.\n\nThe RFML is a tax collected at the fuel pump and is currently set at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel with Sh3 allocated to an annuity fund and the balance to road maintenance, rehabilitation, and development.\n\nRoad maintenance\nThe cost of periodic maintenance per kilometer by KeNHA is expected to move from Sh3.94 million to Sh6.06 million in the current financial year, according to data from KRB.\n\n“There has been an increase in periodic maintenance cost by about 35 percent attributable to the uptake of roads with failed payments and increase in price construction materials mainly due to rise in fuel prices,” KRB noted in a summary of its 2023/24 annual public roads programme (APRP).\n\nThe State has over the years maintained the country’s road network through the Kenya Roads Board Fund (KRBF), which is mainly financed through the proceeds of the RMLF as well as transit tolls.\n\nRecords show that in the five years from 2018–2022, KRB spent Sh309.74 billion on road maintenance, rehabilitation, and development programmes, excluding the Road Annuity Fund.\n\nThese amounts consisted of Sh128.37billion to KeNHA, KeRRA (84.95billion), KURA (Sh35.24 billion), KWS (Sh31.36billion), county governments(Sh26.69billion) and a Sh31.36billion allocation through the Transport Cabinet Secretary.",
