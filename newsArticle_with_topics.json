According to the department, citizens from the Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Eritrea, Mozambique, San Marino and South Africa will also no longer be charged when filing for eTA applications.\n\nThe department said these are \u00e2\u20ac\u015bcountries which had concluded visa abolitions agreement or signed bilateral visa waiver agreements with the Republic of Kenya.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\n\nThe five had signed visa exemption deals in the last one year. Their exemption from eTA began on February 15, Immigration said in response to a Business Daily inquiry on Wednesday.\n\nBacha Debele, the Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya had on Monday told Ethiopian nationals wishing to travel to Kenya to file free applications for ETA, which remains mandatory.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bMy heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the Government of Kenya for its prompt response and kind decision to remove Ethiopian citizens from Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) related electronic payment requirement,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 he said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bWe kindly inform our citizens that they can enter Kenya without any requirement for visa and its related payment, but the requirement to fill eTA form online before arrival, remains mandatory.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\n\nEthiopia is among the earliest countries to sign visa exemption pacts with Nairobi, with its agreements being in place for the last five decades. But while Kenyans only need valid passports to travel to Ethiopia, Ethiopians had been, for the last two months, required to pay $30 for ETA applied for at least 72 hours before arrival.\n\nThe system has generated complaints, especially from countries that routinely do not demand visas from Kenya. The new changes are part of ongoing consultations with foreign partners to improve it, a source told the Business Daily on Wednesday but gave no timelines on when the review will be completed.\n\nRead: Airlines, crew face Sh1.6m fines for passengers breaching eTA rules\n\nWhile it was launched to ease travel and visa application processes, critics argued the $30 fee is a visa by another name.\n\nImmigration said applications for eTA will still be pegged 72 hours before arrival.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bAn Issued eTA is valid for travel to Kenya within 90 days from the date of issue.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\n\nHowever, it may face another question from critics who say the eTA application is not flexible, especially if one adjusts travel times or needs emergency travel.\n\nAs it is, East African Community member states will be exempt from applying for ETA and can travel as long as they have valid passports or national identification.", "url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kenya-exempts-ethiopia-south-africa-from-eta-fees-4532654", "image": "https://internetprotocol.co/content/images/2021/12/Tesla-to-Release-a-Four-Motor-Version-of-Cybertruck.png", "publish_date": "2022-09-30 01:07:48", "author": "Kay Lee", "language": "en", "source_country": "ke", "sentiment_score": 0.9789, "processed_text": "kenya exempts ethiopia south africa e travel authorisation fee kenya begun twitching online visitor registration service policymakers wanted use ease travel country saw country complain high charge department immigration citizen service say citizen ethiopia five country required pay 30 per traveller charged visitor apply come kenya fee often paid online via portal government launched electronic travel authorisation eta january according department citizen comoros congo brazzaville eritrea mozambique san marino south africa also longer charged filing eta application department said country concluded visa abolition agreement signed bilateral visa waiver agreement republic kenya five signed visa exemption deal last one year exemption eta began february 15 immigration said response business daily inquiry wednesday bacha debele ethiopian ambassador kenya monday told ethiopian national wishing travel kenya file free application eta remains mandatory heartfelt thanks appreciation government kenya prompt response kind decision remove ethiopian citizen electronic travel authorisation eta related electronic payment requirement said kindly inform citizen enter kenya without requirement visa related payment requirement fill eta form online arrival remains mandatory ethiopia among earliest country sign visa exemption pact nairobi agreement place last five decade kenyan need valid passport travel ethiopia ethiopian last two month required pay 30 eta applied least 72 hour arrival system generated complaint especially country routinely demand visa kenya new change part ongoing consultation foreign partner improve source told business daily wednesday gave timeline review completed read airline crew face sh1 6m fine passenger breaching eta rule launched ease travel visa application process critic argued 30 fee visa another name immigration said application eta still pegged 72 hour arrival issued eta valid travel kenya within 90 day date issue however may face another question critic say eta application flexible especially one adjusts travel time need emergency travel east african community member state exempt applying eta travel long valid passport national identification", "topics": ["eta", "travel", "kenya", "visa", "country", "application", "citizen", "said", "ethiopia", "ethiopian"]}, {"title": "Kenya Eurobond yields fall as investor jitters recede", "text": "Yields on Kenyan Eurobonds have fallen into the single digits territory as investor jitters wear off following the partial payment of the Sh285.6 billion ($2 billion) debut Eurobond.\n\nInterest rates on the Eurobond maturing in June have, for instance, tumbled to 9.93 percent as of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close from a high of 15.09 percent on February 9, 2024.\n\nThe return from other Eurobond issues has marked a similar turn with yields on the seven-year sovereign bond maturing in 2027 hitting a low of 8.611 percent from 11.64 percent over the same period.\n\nYields on the 10-year Eurobond maturing in 2028, the 12-year bond maturing in 2032 and the 13-year bond maturing in 2034 have similarly fallen to 9.475, 9.939 percent and 9.749 respectively.\n\nInterest rates on the longer-dated 30-year Eurobond maturing in 2048 have also eased considerably to 10.436 percent from 10.82 percent on February 7.\n\nAccording to analysts, the falling yields mirror a risk adjustment on Kenyan sovereign assets in the international capital markets as investor concerns surrounding the ability of the country to meet maturities shrink.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bThe risk premium attached to the 2024 Eurobond has eased, leading to the fall in yields.

The operations will include debt swaps and buy-backs,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 said the National Treasury in its medium-term debt strategy report.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bThe government also endeavours to maintain its presence in international financial markets through refinancing the existing commercial maturities and mobilising resources for budget support.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\n\nTo make the buyback,

seen its fortune turn after the new issuance released fresh dollar inflows in the market.\n\nThe inflows have improved the forex liquidity in the market featuring the release of dollars by hoarders,
